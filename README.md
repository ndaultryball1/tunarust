Options pricing in rust - spare time project

This project is my first in rust, and a way for me to learn both the language and numerical options pricing methods.

I plan to implement finite difference and monte-carlo methods for european options.

Status:

* Explicit forward difference for Europeans - done
* Implicit methods for Europeans - TBC
* Monte Carlo methods - TBC
